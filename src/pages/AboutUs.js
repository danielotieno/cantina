I grew up on the emerald isle of Ireland and I loved everything about food and travel. Growing up on a family farm, I loved nothing more than to be covered from head to toe in cow dung and learning to drive a tractor. At an early age, I worked as a butcher boy part-time between to learn all he could about meat and where the different cuts came from a carcass. As the years went on Davidâ€™s love for passionately grew in food and learning from food people alike on YouTube. Embracing new cultures, countries and food. My goal is to share with you and make you smile and laugh along the way.'
